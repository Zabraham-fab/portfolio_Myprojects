Phonebook Microservice Web Application aims to create a web application with MySQL Database using Docker and Kubernetes to give students the understanding of Microservice architecture. In this application, we have a frontend service and a backend service to interact with database service. Each service will be managed by a Kubernetes deployment. The backend service will be a gateway for the application and it will serve the necessary web pages for create, delete and update operations while the frontend service will serve a search page in order to conduct read operations. To preserve the data in the database, persistent volume and persistent volume claim concepts should be adopted.

The Clarusway Web-Page Application aims to deploy web-page written Nodejs and React Frameworks on AWS Cloud Infrastructure using Ansible. Building infrastructure process is managing with control node utilizing Ansible. This infrastructure has 1 control node and 3 EC2's as worker node. These EC2's will be launched on AWS console. Web-page has 3 main components which are postgresql, nodejs, and react. Each component is serving in Docker container on EC2s dedicated for them. Postgresql is serving as Database of web-page. Nodejs controls backend part of web-side and react controls frontend side of web-page. The code was written by Clarusway's Developers and architecture will be created by Clarusway's AWS & DevOps Team.
